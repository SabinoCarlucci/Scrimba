Projects from Scrimba.com

Scrimba.com is a great website for learning how to code from simple, step-by-step courses, both free and paid.
Here you'll find some projects from said courses, or at least the solutions I came up with.

Feel free to leave constructive feedback or make pull requests, my code probably needs improving.
